# Sherbal
## A Reddit-like Ruby on Rails Application

I wrote this application using the [Richard Schneeman](http://schneems.com/) [*UT on Rails Tutorial*](http://schneems.com/ut-rails) as preparation for Dev Bootcamp.

Check out the application [here](http://sherbal.herokuapp.com).

### To Do:
1. Sort links by number of votes
2. Create another page where links are sorted by date created
3. Allow users to share links on Facebook and Twitter
4. Allow users to signin with Facebook, Twitter, or Github
5. Add nested comments functionality
6. Create a Chrome extension to be able to add links to remotely
